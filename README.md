## Description: Created a an HTML responsive website from a prototype that utilizes BootStrap's library of components and custom css classes. The project also has custom css classes that overwrite BootStrap's css presets and psuedo CSS classes for styling and to get it close to the prototype. As well as, has media queries that allow the website to be responsive for both desktop and mobile devices. The project also has a JavaScript script file that calls upon data from a JSON file and is linked to the HTML elements.

# November 20, 2025 -  Made changes to the project so they reflect the suggestions made from the peer review. Added a media query with CSS classes and applied those classes to HTML elements so that the website is reponsive to tablet screens and fixed the layout for tablet.

## Peer Review (Name) - Joseph Duarte " everything looks great, you did an awesome job. the only suggestion i have is, when you are in tablet mode the "Daily" and "monthly" buttons are just a little too close to the edge but not by much. Aside from that everything is great!
